## ðŸ¤” Pain Points and Challenges
1. **Generic Journalling**: Many journalling apps are simply for journalling. It fails to address issues or responses that resonate with the user's unique circumstances.

2. **Lack of Affirmations**:  Affirmations are positive, powerful and motivational statements that can help individuals challenge and overcome negative thoughts. They serve as a tool for self-improvement by reinforcing positive beliefs and fostering a constructive mindset.

- **Why Do Affirmations Matter?** ðŸ¤”  
Research shows that affirmations can activate brain areas associated with self-related processing and reward, making it easier to foster a positive self-image and counteract negative thinking. Affirmations are easier to remember and repeat than complex motivational strategies, which can be beneficial for daily practice.

3. **Lack of Interactivity**: Traditional journaling apps often lack interactivity, leaving users without opportunities for real-time feedback or community support. Many people turn to online communities or social media to vent their feelings and seek support, which can be fragmented and less personal.
 

### ðŸŒŸ Innovative Solutions
1. **Tailored Affirmations**: Affirmly generates affirmations based on user's specific journal entries, ensuring relevance and impact
2. **Quick access of affirmations**: Affirmly not only allows users to save their journal entries, but also affirmations that could be retrieved for re-assurance, repeitions and daily practice
3. **User-Friendly Design**: The intuitive interface and seamless saving process make journaling and organizing entries effortless.
